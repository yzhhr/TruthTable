`play.cpp` is a too-long cpp code, while `ttable.nb` provides a neat mathematica implementation. However, the latter is not expected to be accepted by the teacher.

Compile `play.cpp` with `g++ play.cpp -o play -std=c++11`. Then type expressions like `(pvq>r^p)=(q=r)`. You'll figure out what's going on.
